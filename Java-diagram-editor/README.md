There are two sample txt.file(flowchart.txt and mindmap.txt) in the project that you can load into the program.

### **Continued development**

- Save label and label color data when saving a file
- Read and display label when loading a file
- In the current Tic Tac Toe game, it’s always the player to move first. Needs to rotate who starts first each turn.
- In the current Tic Tac Toe game, the computer generates random moves. Can implement Minimax algorithm to make computer play “smarter”.
